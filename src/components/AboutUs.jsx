              Rajni Kumar, the school quickly grew from a small nursery to a
              full-fledged educational institution and made a distinct mark with
              its vibrancy and fresh approach.

                The vision of our founding principal, Dr. Rajni Kumar, has
                always been to create a learning space committed to providing a
                joyous and spirited environment for our children. Today, that
                vision is being taken forward by Dr. Jyoti Bose under whose
                guidance we at Springdales, Pusa Road strive to develop studies
                and skills in our children that will help them become confident
                and responsible global citizens.
              </p>

              <p>
                We firmly believe that today's youth is capable of bringing
                great changes, helping the nation progress in every field. It is
                with this hope and faith that we seek to instil in our children
                values of empathy, leadership and the passion to follow their
                dreams.
